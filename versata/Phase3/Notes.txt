6mention why we think its important
not so many threats -> document the ones we have very well
leaf,root nodes very important
dfd elements very important
'left part' less important
they are not sadists!

Assumptions very important: General assumptions, but also assumptions made
when walking the tree looking for threats. (Why we choose a threat, or why
we don't => document those assumptions as well).
Reasoning and motivation behind certain assumptions are important.
