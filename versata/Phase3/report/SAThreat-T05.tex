\label{par:t03}
% the attributes noted with an asterix (*) are obligated
    \subparagraph{Summary:} The misactor obtains user credentials allowing him to log in and access the system as a user other than himself.
    \subparagraph{Primary mis-actor:} Skilled insider
    \subparagraph{Basic path:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[bf1.]{The misactor gains access to the credentials of a user (by stealing, guessing, etc.)(S\_8, S\_12, S\_13)}
        \item[bf2.]{The misactor uses the credentials to log in to the system as another type of user.}
        \item[bf3.]{The misactor receives all priveleges of the spoofed employee}
    \end{enumerate}
    \subparagraph{Consequence:}
	Confidential data can possibly be viewed by users that are normally not able to view this data.
This misactor could possibly expose sensitive data to the outside.

    \subparagraph{Reference to threat tree node(s):}S\_8, S\_12, S\_13
    \subparagraph{Parent threat tree(s):} ID\_ds, S
    \subparagraph{DFD element(s):} 1. Operator, 2. Researcher
    \subparagraph{Remarks:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[r1.] An authentication system is present in the architecture, which rules out threat S\_4.
        \item[r2.] The authentication process is considered secure (assumption \ref{it:ass15}) thus the tampering threat (leaf of S\_3) does not hold, 
and it does not support null credentials (S\_10) or equivalence (S\_09), downgrade authentication (S\_11) 
or weak change management (S\_09). Also no key distribution storage is present (S\_14).
	\item[r3.] Spoofing due to weak server-side storage (S\_15) is not possible because of assumption \ref{it:ass16}.
	\item[r4.] Spoofing due to weak transit is not possible due to the strong ssl encryption of the communication between entities and portals (assumption \ref{it:ass9}).
	\item[r5.] Spoofing only applies to operators and researchers (assumption \ref{it:ass14}).
	\item[r6.] Spoofing due to weak credential storage on client-side is described in \nameref{par:t04}.
    \end{enumerate}
