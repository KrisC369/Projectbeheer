\subsubsection{Outgoing gateway}
\paragraph{Architectural drivers}
This component can construct SMS, gprs or internet messages and send them.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{UC7': Send trame to remote device}
	The final part of this usecase is sending the trame through the selected
		communication channel.
	\item \textbf{UC9': Notify customer}
	ReMeS will send the constructed message to the recipient.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Tactics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Performance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Resource arbitration\\
		Different scheduling policies can be used. Currently the FIFO scheduling policy is used in this component.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Architectural Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Active Object \\
	The active object pattern allows us to insert new user notification requests in a scheduler. The scheduler can
		then decide which requests to handle first.  Currently the scheduler will handle
		the requests FIFO.
	\item Proxy \\
	To increase the modifiability of the internal working of this component we chose
		to use the explicit interface pattern. The interface that we see outside the
		component will simply delegate it's methods to an internal component.
	\item Requestor \\
	To send messages across the internet, through sms or gprs, we opted for a
		requestor pattern.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Verification and refinement of drivers}
All the architectural drivers have been satisfied.
