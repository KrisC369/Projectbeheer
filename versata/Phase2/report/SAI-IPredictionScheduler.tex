\paragraph{Interface Identity}
This interface is provided by the Scheduler for consumption prediction
	requests. This interface is different from IScheduler because it
	requires more information.
\paragraph{Resources Provided}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{ConsumptionPrediction requestPrediction(PredictionType type)}\\
	This method will schedule a consumption prediction. When the requested prediction
		is computed, this method will also return the prediction.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Data Type Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item ConsumptionPrediction\\
	A computed consumption prediction.
	\item PredictionType\\
	The type of the requested consumption prediction. This structure contains the utility
		and the time frame.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Exception Definitions}
