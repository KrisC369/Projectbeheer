\subsubsection{Computation of consumption prediction}
\paragraph{Architectural drivers}
The only purpose of this component is computing requested consumption predictions.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{UC14': Request consumption prediction}
\end{itemize}
No further decomposition of this component is required.
