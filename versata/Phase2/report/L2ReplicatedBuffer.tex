\subsubsection{Buffer}
This section handles the decomposition of the Buffer component inside the Scheduler for incoming measurement trames.
\paragraph{Architectural drivers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AV1: Measurement database failure }\\
	When switching between normal and degraded modus, no new measurements are lost.
	When the database component fails, incoming measurements should be stored elsewhere and it should be possible to store at least 3 hours of measurement messages.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Tactics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Availability
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Recovery Preparation and repair \\
		In order to make sure that 3 hours worth of messages can be stored in case something goes wrong, and to make this storage more prepared against failures, some form of active redundancy needs to be implemented.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Architectural Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Replicated Component group}\\
	The replicated component group pattern ensures that the buffer holding the measurement trames is in fact distributed over different locations making this buffer more redundant. In case of failure no new measurements will be lost since there will always be a buffer instance ready to store this data. The buffer should be able to store 3 hours worth of data. 
\end{itemize}
