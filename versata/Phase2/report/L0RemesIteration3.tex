\subsubsection{ReMeS}
This decomposition will manage all use cases that are not related to any QAS.
\paragraph{Architectural drivers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{UC1: } Log in
	\item \textbf{UC2: } Log off
	\item \textbf{UC3: } Register customer
	\item \textbf{UC4: } Unregister customer
	\item \textbf{UC5: } Associate device to customer
	\item \textbf{UC6: } Customize customer profile
	\item \textbf{UC11: } Operate actuator remotely
	\item \textbf{UC12: } Set alarm recipients
	\item \textbf{UC14: } Request consumption predictions
	\item \textbf{UC16: } Mark invoice paid
	\item \textbf{UC17: } Perform research
\end{itemize}
Most of these use cases are dependent on User Interaction. Therefor we will
	introduce a new component: User Interaction.

\paragraph{Tactics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Performance
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Resource arbitration \\
		Because consumption predictions are a computational intensive task, we
			will foresee a scheduler for these requests
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}



\paragraph{Architectural Patterns}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Command processor \\
	The command processor pattern will be used for the implementation of the consumption prediction scheduler. Often the functionality of the scheduler, as described in the command processor pattern, will be split up into two separate components. 
	These components are the buffer where the requests are stored and the actual scheduler that empties the buffer and schedules the consumption predictions. This shows a more explicit view of the workings of such a scheduler without going into another deeper level of ADD design.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Verification and refinement of drivers}
None of the architectural drivers have been satisfied. Most of them are
	delegated to the user interaction component. Consumption predictions are delegated to the scheduler.
\textbf{User Interaction}
