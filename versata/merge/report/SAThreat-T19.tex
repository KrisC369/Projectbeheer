\label{par:t12}
% the attributes noted with an asterix (*) are obligated
    \subparagraph{Summary:} The user is unaware of the consequences of sharing information (e.g. by sharing
too much information even anonymized data can reveal the user's identity).
    \subparagraph{Primary mis-actor:} Management
    \subparagraph{Basic path:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[bf1.] The management fails to add as requirement the need of notifications and warnings when the
patients intends to upload sensitive and/or identifiable content.
        \item[bf2.] The user adds information to the system which can easily identify him (e.g. a picture of
himself) as he is unaware of the consequences.
    \end{enumerate}
    \subparagraph{Consequence:} When ReMeS processes retreive information, the identifiable information is
returned. The user's privacy is thus violated as he assumes that his information stays confidential
and his identity will not be revealed.


    \subparagraph{Reference to threat tree node(s):} U\_1
    \subparagraph{Parent threat tree(s):} U
    \subparagraph{DFD element(s):} 3. consumer
    \subparagraph{Remarks:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[r1.] This threat only applies to the consumer (assumption \ref{it:ass10} and \ref{it:ass11}).
        \item[r2.] The threat concerning inaccurate user information is described in \nameref{par:t13}.
