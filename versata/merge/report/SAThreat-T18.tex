    \subparagraph{Summary:} The management fails to request a design and implementation of the system in
compliance with legislation.
    \subparagraph{Primary mis-actor:} Management
    \subparagraph{Basic path:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item[bf1.] The misactor fails to require a system that is legally compliant (either he is unaware of the
legislation or he consciously decides to ignore it).
        \item[bf2.] The customer data is not processed or collected in accordance to (privacy) legislation.
    \end{enumerate}
    \subparagraph{Consequence:} The customer's personal information is shared without his knowledge. When
detected, ReMeS can get fined, and its trustworthy reputation is ruined.
