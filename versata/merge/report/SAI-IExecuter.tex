\subsubsection{IExecuter}
\paragraph{Interface Identity}
This interface is provided by the Service request executer component. The methods
	of this interface are very similar to those of the IUserInteraction interface.
	All the methods are the same, except that they don't have an AuthToken. Every method
	of IUserInteraction is also provided by this interface (except for the login method).
	For further information we refer to section \ref{sec:IUserInteraction}.
