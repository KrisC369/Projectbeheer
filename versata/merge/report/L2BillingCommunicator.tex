\paragraph{Architectural drivers}
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{AV3: Third Party Billing Service failure}
	It is possible that the third party billing service is unreachable. ReMeS
		must detect this and make sure no invoices are lost. This component will
		take care of that.
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Tactics}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Availability
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fault Detection\\
		The 3th party billing service communicator must detect when an error occurs with sending an invoice to the Third
			Party Billing Service. Whenever it sends an invoice, the Third Party
			Billing Service should send an acknowledgement back to the communicator.
