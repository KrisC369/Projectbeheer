\paragraph{Interface Identity}
This interface is provided by components who can compute a
	consumption prediction. At the moment the only component
	with this functionality is the Computation of consumption
	prediction component.
\paragraph{Resources Provided}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{ConsumptionPrediction computePrediction(MeasurementData data)}\\
	This method will request a consumption prediction with the given data.
		The method returns the prediction.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Data Type Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item MeasurementData\\
	A set of measurement data needed to compute a consumption prediction.
	\item ConsumptionPrediction\\
	A computed consumption prediction.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Exception Definitions}
