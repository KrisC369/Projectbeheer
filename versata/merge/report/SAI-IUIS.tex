\subsubsection{IUIS}
\paragraph{Interface Identity}
This interface is provided by the component that is responsible for the connection
	with the UIS.
\paragraph{Resources Provided}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{UserInfo getCustomerInfo(UserInfo userInfo)}\\
	This method will request all info that the UIS has of a customer. The method will
		pass a UserInfo object (that not necessarily needs to contain all information
		of a customer, only a predefined set of info which the UIS needs to identify
		the correct customer) and return a UserInfo object (which can contain more or
		different information of a customer).
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Data Type Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item UserInfo\\
	Data type that contains information of a user.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Exception Definitions}
\begin{itemize}
	\item IncompleteDataException\\
	This exception can be thrown by getCustomerInfo(UserInfo userInfo). It is thrown
		when the UserInfo object does not contain sufficient data to correctly identify
		the customer.
	\item CommunicationException\\
	This exception can be thrown if the component fails to establish a connection with
		the external source.
\end{itemize}
